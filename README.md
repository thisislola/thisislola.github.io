# 🌈 Hey there! 🌈

⬅️ That's me and yes, that is a Brontosaurus necklace.

My name is Lorena Carthy-Wilmot (pronouns she/her) and I work as **Head of Lab/Digital Forensics Investigator** for the Forensic Technology Services Lab (FTS Lab) at PwC in Oslo, Norway. 

I have a **BSc (Hons) in Digital Forensics** from the Noroff University College in Kristiansand (Norway), and as of January 2022, I am researching for a **MSc in Cybersecurity** at the Teesside University in Middlesbrough, United Kingdom (online/part-time). Right after, I will be working towards Microsoft and MAD certifications, so wish me luck!

I love everything related to forensics and I could talk about it for hours. I am also interested in OSINT, CTI, InfoSec and trying new tools.

## 💻 Blog
I have an absurd amount of 'Untitled documents' with research bits and how-tos that I find personally helpful, but I have not being able to share this as I have been studying/working full time. Not a great excuse, I know. However, I have decided to start cleaning it up and posting it [on a Medium site](https://medium.com/@randomdent) (you can find me as @randomdent there). 
Ps: You might identify references to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, MaddAddam triology, Greek Mythology or dinosaurs in most of my side projects! This is how I keep track :)
