# üåà Hey there! üåà

My name is Lorena Carthy-Wilmot (pronouns: she/her/hers) and I work in the field of Digital Forensics and Incident Response at the Police in Norway. Previously, I was the Head for the Forensic Technology Services Lab at PwC in Oslo. 

I have a BSc (Hons) in Digital Forensics from the Noroff University College (Kristiansand, Norway) and a MSc in Cybersecurity from the Teesside University in Middlesbrough, United Kingdom.

I SERIOUSLY love everything related to forensics, but specifically digital forensics (of course!) and I could talk about it for hours! I am also interested in OSINT, Cyber Threat Intelligence, InfoSec and trying new tools, doing some research.

Other subjects: Diversity & inclusion, Accessibility, Deaf in Tech, BIPOC in Tech, LGBTQAI+.

## üíª Blog
I have an absurd amount of 'Untitled documents' with research bits and how-tos that I find personally helpful, but I have not being able to share this as I have been studying/working full time. Not a great excuse, I know. However, I have decided to start cleaning it up and posting it [on a Medium site](https://medium.com/@randomdent) (you can find me as @randomdent there). 
Ps: You might identify references to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, MaddAddam triology, Greek Mythology or dinosaurs in most of my side projects! This is how I keep track :)
