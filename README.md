# üåà About me üåà

Hello! I'm Lorena Carthy-Wilmot, and I have the privilege of working in the dynamic field of **Digital Forensics and Incident Response** with the Norwegian Police. My role involves unraveling the complexities of crimes and investigations where digital evidence is involved, a challenge that I find both fascinating and rewarding. Before embarking on this journey, I gained valuable experience as the Head of the Forensic Technology Services Lab at PwC in Oslo, a role that sharpened my skills and deepened my passion for this field.

Academically, my journey has been deeply rooted in the fields of digital forensics and cybersecurity. I earned my **BSc (Hons) in Digital Forensics** from Noroff University College in the scenic Kristiansand, Norway. Pursuing further specialization, I completed my **MSc in Cybersecurity** at Teesside University in Middlesbrough, UK. These experiences not only enriched my knowledge, but also fueled my passion for uncovering digital truths.

But here's the thing: **my love for forensics isn't just a career choice, it's a burning passion!** Especially digital forensics ‚Äìit's like a puzzle I can't wait to solve. I could spend hours discussing the latest in technology, OSINT, Cyber Threat Intelligence, and InfoSec, not to mention experimenting with new tools and diving into research.

Beyond the digital domain, I'm also passionate about creating a more inclusive tech world. I actively advocate for **diversity and inclusion**, focusing on the importance of accessibility in technology. My commitment extends to supporting the Deaf community within the tech industry and championing the voices of BIPOC and LGBTQAI+ individuals in tech spaces. These efforts are vital for me, as they reflect my belief in a tech industry that welcomes and celebrates diversity in all its forms.

So, if you're ready for a deep dive into the world of digital forensics, would like to invite me to talk/present at your event or if you're curious about how we can make tech more inclusive, let's chat! I'm here, ready to share, learn, and explore. Welcome to my world ‚Äìa place where digital mysteries meet diversity and inclusion! üåêüîç‚ú®
