# 🌈 Hey there! 🌈

My name is Lorena Carthy-Wilmot (pronouns: she/her/hers) and I work as a **Senior Adviser for the Digital Police Work (Digitalt Politiarbeid - DPA)** section of the Joint Intelligence and Investigation Unit (Felles enhet for etterforskning og etterretning - FEE) at the Police in Norway. Previously, I was the Head for the Forensic Technology Services Lab (FTS Lab) at PwC in Oslo. 

I have a **BSc (Hons) in Digital Forensics** from the Noroff University College in Kristiansand, and as of May 2022, I am researching for a **MSc in Cybersecurity** at the Teesside University in Middlesbrough, United Kingdom (online/part-time).

I love everything related to forensics and I could talk about it for hours! I am also interested in OSINT, CTI, InfoSec and trying new tools/research.

Other subjects: Diversity & inclusion, Accessibility, Deaf in Tech, BIPOC in Tech, LGBTQAI+.

## 💻 Blog
I have an absurd amount of 'Untitled documents' with research bits and how-tos that I find personally helpful, but I have not being able to share this as I have been studying/working full time. Not a great excuse, I know. However, I have decided to start cleaning it up and posting it [on a Medium site](https://medium.com/@randomdent) (you can find me as @randomdent there). 
Ps: You might identify references to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, MaddAddam triology, Greek Mythology or dinosaurs in most of my side projects! This is how I keep track :)
